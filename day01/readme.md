# 2020 Advent of code solutions
> re-learning ruby through advent of code

These were all done on the days them happened

Sometime around day 20-23 I started to lose interest due various factors

- one of the examples was very misleading and I ended up stuck on it for a while despite my initial code actually being correct
- there were more math related questions and while I do enjoy learning new concepts, these were outside of what I felt I could reasonably understand at the time
- I solved two of them by sheer luck and I have no idea why those solutions work (well I understand from a broad overview, not precisely why)
- various external factors

However overall, I did enjoy the event and learned the joy of ruby once again.

There's something beautiful about how ruby works and looks to me, despite it's many many flaws.

Not every solution here may be 100% complete, as I occasionally solved some of them elsewhere in different languages (day 20 was 3 parts with 3 different language all in different places)

Personally I quite like how my VanEch sequence came out (enough to add it to rosetta code)

Probably one of my most used pieces of knowledge (beyond re-learning ruby) that I learned from this has been learning about earley parsers and subsequently pratt parsing, they have been very valuable to me as I work with parsers a lot.

Anyways, thanks for reading this strange readme and checking this out.
